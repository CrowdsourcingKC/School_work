### Ruby - Leap Year Checker
***

#### Objective
Create a checker that verifies if an input year is a leap year, and if not gives you the next leap year. This was also intended to work from Time Immemorial, so BC works as well. It even lets you know if you've gone back in time.

#### Steps Taken
First I created the logic for what /is/ a leap year. Afterwards I was created conditional formatting to capture if the number met that logic or didn't. From there I incremented the year until the next year that met the leap year requirements.

Here is the code for [Leap Year Checker](https://github.com/danielramsayer/School_work/blob/master/random-programs/Ruby/1.1.rb).


#### The Result

The leap year checker works well and was a fun project to do. Perhaps a birthday clock is in the future to determine peoples zodiacs?
