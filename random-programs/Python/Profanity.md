### Python - Profanity Checker
***

#### Objective
Check for a list of swear words and then list the word and the number of times it's used.

#### Steps Taken
This opens a file from your directory and checks the words in it against the listed profanity. The words could be anything, not just profanity, but profanity seems like the most interesting right out of the gates.

#### The Result

This program accurately does what it sets out to do, but I could make it more easily user friendly and make both the place the file is and the words to check more easily accessible.
