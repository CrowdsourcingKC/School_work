### Python - Pyglatin Translator
***

#### Objective
This was meant to produce pyglatin phrases, as I am not myself particularly good at making them.

#### Steps Taken
This is a cute, simple program that wants to perform a simple task of translation for those who want to write in Pyglatin. If you are looking to speak in pyglatin, this does not necessarily help with that.

Here is the code for [the Pyglatin Translator](https://github.com/danielramsayer/School_work/blob/master/random-programs/Python/Pyg.py).

#### The Result

A working translator that is good for one thing, confusing telemarketers.
