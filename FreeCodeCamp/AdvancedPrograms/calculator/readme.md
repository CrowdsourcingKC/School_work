### Javascript - Calculator
***

#### Objective
To build a fully functional small form factor calculator that is at least minorly appealing.

#### Steps Taken
I began by focusing on the visual representation after deciding which kinds of activities I want the calculator to have.

From the finished visual product I was able to the create the backend logic which supported clearing the entire calculation, to deleting current array information, to backspace. I have * / + - and = buttons that all complete what they intend to do.

The program is able to handle the product if the product is a float or an int.

Here is the code for the [calculator](https://github.com/danielramsayer/School_work/tree/master/FreeCodeCamp/AdvancedPrograms/calculator).

Here is a CodePen functional version of [the calculator](https://codepen.io/Daniel_Ramsayer/pen/GvNLXQ)

#### The Result

My calculator is a success. It's rather plain, but I felt that for a simple calculator that this was alright.
