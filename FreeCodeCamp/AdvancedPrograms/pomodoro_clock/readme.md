### Javascript - Pomodoro Clock
***

#### Objective
Create a type of Pomodoro clock with a graphical interface, times that can be selected for, and sounds to alert the person using the clock that the type of time type has changed.

#### Steps Taken
I created the visual front end with a simple form, something that is easy on the eyes. I selected two type of sections, one for the break time and one for the session time.

The graphics for what kind of time it is change based on what session that the time is in, a coffee cup for break and a computer monitor for working. It automatically shifts between the two as sessions elapse.

Here is the code for [Simon](https://github.com/danielramsayer/School_work/tree/master/FreeCodeCamp/AdvancedPrograms/pomodoro_clock).

Here is a CodePen functional version of [the Pomodoro Clock](https://codepen.io/Daniel_Ramsayer/pen/OjpKPX)

#### The Result

I believe that this is a fair representation of a pomodoro game. It's has some area's I would like to work on a little more, such as a pause feature, maybe a table for tracking work?
