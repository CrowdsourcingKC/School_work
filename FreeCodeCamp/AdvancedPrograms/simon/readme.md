#### Objective
Create a Simon Says clone with a graphical interface, sounds, and 20 levels of randomly generated color nodes to challenge a player to better short term memory adaptability. Hard and easy variety.

#### Steps Taken
I created the visual front end with a simple form factor, a start button and a toggle switch for strict and non-strict modes.

The back end ties random integers with one of 4 color options, linking sounds to the color, and storing each new number on an array. As the player repeats the computer pattern, if they are correct they have the game then trigger a new number until the player reaches the end. If they are incorrect then then depending on if they are in strict mode or not they either have the pattern repeated or they lose the game and have to start over.

Here is the code for [Simon](https://github.com/danielramsayer/School_work/tree/master/FreeCodeCamp/AdvancedPrograms/simon).

Here is a CodePen functional version of [the Simon game](https://codepen.io/Daniel_Ramsayer/pen/dzawQz)

#### The Result

I believe that this Simon clone is a fair representation of the original game. It's has some area's I would like to work on a little more, such as textures, or maybe keep a score board to let you know how far others have gotten.
