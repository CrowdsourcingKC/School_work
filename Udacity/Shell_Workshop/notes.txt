Shell Commands

*Echo - meant to repeat whatever was created in the prompt by the user.
*Echo...!! - Fun one, repeats the prior command from the terminal - ie 'some command' -> 'echo !!' => 'echo some command'.
*Unusual Behavior - if you experience unusual behavior, you may have hit a reserved word or characters. Try encapsulating with quotes or look up words in the input.
*ls - lists files and directories in a directory.
   ls . -list current directory
   ls ~ -list home directory
   ls l - list directory contents in the long way. gives additional information like reader/writer status, owner, size, date access... ect.
   ls -l Folder/*.filetype - this will list all files of a type in a folder.
   ls word_in_file_name* - this finds all files with a word in the name.
*cd - moves you through directories, whether up 'cd ThisDirectory' or down ' cd ../..' for two folders down.
*Dual commands - if you place a ';' in between two commands in a prompt it will execute them in order. 'cd ../ ; ls'.
*PWD - (Print working directory) if you get off the beaten track this one shows you where you are.
*mkdir - (Make Directory) creates a folder. This can be a nested folder based on a cd like transversal. Mkdir Documents/Books will create the Books folder in the Documents folder without first having to navigate there. Relative, you must be in a folder in the chain.
*mv - moves files. Two parts 'Where I want to move from' to 'Where I want to move to'. For all file types from one directory for another one would do 'mv Documents/*.pdf Documents/Books' to move all pdfs from one folder to the next.

  curl -L - follow any page redirects for a page in case it's moved.
  curl -o filenameyouwant.fileextensionyouwant -L 'website' downloads the information from the web and places it in a file for you.
*cat - File reader, this takes a file and spits it right back out.
*less - like cat, but only reveals a page at a time for easier understanding by the reader.
