Shell Commands

*Echo - meant to repeat whatever was created in the prompt by the user.
*Echo...!! - Fun one, repeats the prior command from the terminal - ie 'some command' -> 'echo !!' => 'echo some command'.
*Unusual Behavior - if you experience unusual behavior, you may have hit a reserved word or characters. Try encapsulating with quotes or look up words in the input.
*ls - lists files and directories in a directory.
   ls . -list current directory
   ls ~ -list home directory
   ls l - list directory contents in the long way. gives additional information like reader/writer status, owner, size, date access... ect.
   ls -l Folder/*.filetype - this will list all files of a type in a folder.
   ls word_in_file_name* - this finds all files with a word in the name.
*cd - moves you through directories, whether up 'cd ThisDirectory' or down ' cd ../..' for two folders down.
*Dual commands - if you place a ';' in between two commands in a prompt it will execute them in order. 'cd ../ ; ls'.
*PWD - (Print working directory) if you get off the beaten track this one shows you where you are.
*mkdir - (Make Directory) creates a folder. This can be a nested folder based on a cd like transversal. Mkdir Documents/Books will create the Books folder in the Documents folder without first having to navigate there. Relative, you must be in a folder in the chain.
*mv - moves files. Two parts 'Where I want to move from' to 'Where I want to move to'. For all file types from one directory for another one would do 'mv Documents/*.pdf Documents/Books' to move all pdfs from one folder to the next.
*Curl - (See URL) This is a download option for terminal for urls.
  curl -L - follow any page redirects for a page in case it's moved.
  curl -o filenameyouwant.fileextensionyouwant -L 'website' downloads the information from the web and places it in a file for you.
*cat - File reader, this takes a file and spits it right back out.
*less - like cat, but only reveals a page at a time for easier understanding by the reader.
*rm - remove a file from a place. Ex 'rm 'Bad File' 'Goodface bad file'' or 'rm *'Bad F'*'
*rmdir - remove a folder and files from a directory.
*grep - search command to search files for particular words, such as "grep search_word filename.txt" it will spit out all words with the search_word in it, and the count of the characters in those words. There are certain augmentations that can be done with it such as:
  less - "grep search_word filename.txt | less" shows you 'pages' of responses.
  curl - "curl -L website_url | grep search_word"
  wc - word count option, "grep search_word filename.txt | wc" (-l will count lines at the end)
  -c - another word count option, just returns a number though "grep -c search_word filename.txt"
*Shell Variable - a code word native to the shell, accessed with '$', such as '$LINES'.
*$PATH - tells you where your programs are.
*PWD - pathway to current location
*(.bash_profile) - File that does some terminal or shell set up configuration.
*$PS1 - tied with .bash_profile, that controls the command prompt in the shell.
*alias - this sets variables, so any above command you can give an alias to and for that shells existence the alias works. Permenant alias's should be in the .bash file.
